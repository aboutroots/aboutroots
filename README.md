hello there :wave:

I like 

- clear conventions, like [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- automated workflows, like [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- colorful editors and nice things like [vim awesome](https://vimawesome.com/), [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), [powerline](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell), [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls), [base16 themes](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16), [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)
- [terminator](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator)
- vim keybindings
- adding types to Python and JS functions :yum:
- functions that know what they are doing
- extracting booleans to variables to tell a story
- test cases that imitate business scenarios
- classes, they seem to be doing more good than harm

I work mostly with Python, JS and Dart.
